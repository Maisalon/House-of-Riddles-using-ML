"House of Riddles Using ML" is designed to provide an immersive and intellectually stimulating gaming experience. Players are immersed in a dynamic 3D environment where they navigate through different houses, each containing a series of complex quizzes. As players solve a quiz for each house, they gain scores that contribute to their overall progress. Correct answers increase their score, which in turn raises the level of the game, making future challenges more difficult. The game leverages advanced artificial intelligence and reinforcement machine learning to further enrich the experience. The ML system offers real-time analysis of the player's current state, providing recommendations and hints personalized to their needs while dynamically adjusting the difficulty to keep the game both challenging and fun. This sophisticated approach ensures that players are constantly engaged and motivated. Data from the game is securely managed and stored using an AWS RDS MySQL instance, ensuring that progress and metrics are preserved. The game is developed with Unity, and server-client interactions are managed using a REST API, ensuring seamless connectivity and performance. By combining these elements, "House of Riddles Using ML" aims to provide a unique and engaging alternative to traditional idle games, promote cognitive development and provide a highly interactive gaming experience.
